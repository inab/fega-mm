  <div class="col-md-9">
     <p>The maturity model is envisioned as a mechanism to drive engagement and disengagement of nodes being part of the EGA federation. This model is divided into different domains and subdomains with a 5-levels scale. The first two levels are deemed to drive the initial interactions of an organization willing to join the Federated EGA ecosystem. Levels 3 and 4 aim to establish clear guidelines to reach a fully operational Federated EGA Node. Level 5 is designed to facilitate periodic review of the different indicators as well as to ensure the adoption of the most up-to-date technical and legal specifications.</p>
