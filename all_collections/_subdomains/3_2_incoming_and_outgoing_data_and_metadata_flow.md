 - indicator: '[3.2.1] Incoming Data flow in the federated EGA node is established'
   levels:
    - level: 1
      desc: 'None'
    - level: 2
      desc: 'First mechanisms for receiving and processing data submissions are designed.'
    - level: 3  
      desc: 'Ad-hoc incoming data flow into the Federeated EGA node. This is a largely unautomated process.'
    - level: 4
      desc: 'Accept data only in formats agreed using standard data reception services. Accepted formats follows the general agreement reached at the Federated EGA ecosystem'
    - level: 5
      desc: 'Periodic review of existing incoming data mechanisms to guarantee up-to-date implementations and the opportunity to incorporate newly accepted data-types and developed data transfer protocols for accepted data-types'

 - indicator: '[3.2.2] Outgoing Data flow in the federated EGA node is established'
   levels:
    - level: 1
      desc: 'None'
    - level: 2
      desc: 'First methods are drafted and proposed for the data distribution out of the Federated EGA node.'
    - level: 3  
      desc: 'Ad-hoc distribution of data out of the Federated EGA node to approved users using labour intensive protocols e.g., staging and distribution via Globus.'
    - level: 4
      desc: 'Data can flow out of node in a semi-automated or self-service way for approved users using secure protocols, e.g. encrypted data, secure transfer protocol. Majority of data distribution scenarios agreed by the Federated EGA ecosystem are supported by the node'
    - level: 5
      desc: 'Periodic review of existing data distribution mechanisms to guarantee up-to-date implementations and the opportunity to incorporate newly accepted data-types, developed data transfer protocols as well as to scale-up the service to cope with increasing use, including the use of standards for partial data retrieval, e.g. htsget for sequencing/variant data.'

 - indicator: '[3.2.3] Mechanisms for sharing metadata and other operations-oriented information are established between the federated EGA node and Central EGA'
   levels:
    - level: 1
      desc: 'None'
    - level: 2
      desc: 'Information to be exchanged between the federated EGA and Central EGA is drafted.'
    - level: 3  
      desc: 'Communication interfaces and common data standards are well defined. Information, operations-oriented & public metadata, e.g. study metadata, accessions, can be exchanged between the federated EGA node and Central EGA in a manual way.'
    - level: 4
      desc: 'Information, operations-oriented & public metadata, e.g. study metadata, accessions, is exchanged between the federated EGA node and Central EGA in an automated or scheduled way.'
    - level: 5
      desc: 'Periodic review of exchange information to ensure up-to-date implementations as well as to facilitate the adoption of new standards and newly developed technologies. This periodic review can facilitate the redefinition of exchanged information.'
